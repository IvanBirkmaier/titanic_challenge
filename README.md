# Kaggle Titanic Challenge - AI Engineering Master's Project

This repository contains the code for my attempt to solve the Kaggle Titanic Challenge. The complete competition can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/leaderboard).

## Project Description

This approach was developed as part of a course in my AI Engineering Master's program. One significant challenge was the limitation in the provided data: the "Sex" column was missing, making the task more difficult.

### Key Points:
- **Data**: All used data can be found in the `CSV` folder.
- **Notebook**: The Jupyter Notebook is thoroughly documented and includes all necessary steps to reproduce the results.
- **Result**: With the chosen approach, a accuracy score of **81.1818%** was achieved, placing this approach in the top 200 out of over 17,200 participants (as of July 2024).
- **Usage**: To replicate the results, simply run the notebook.
